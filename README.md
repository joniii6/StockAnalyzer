# StockAnalyzer

“Stock Analyzer” was created within the framework of the course: “Introduction to Programming” by Mario Sillic at the University of St.Gallen. The aim of “Stock Analyzer” was to build a web application on which market data and stock information were more accessible for interested parties.

## 1.) Introduction

Have you ever felt like some investment platforms just are not user friendly enough? 
Most of the time all kinds of information are displayed for each financial instrument listed, although not all of them provide useful data to derive efficient investment decisions. This somewhat lack of overview led us to create “Stock Analyzer'' : A summarised web application with key numbers and company information we feel crucial to have access to from an investors perspective. By gathering information on historic data, company information and key financial ratios, the idea of the application was to provide potential investors with the toolkit to make data-backed investment decisions.
